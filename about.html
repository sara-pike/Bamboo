        <p>Bamboo Design &amp; Build is a Jersey based Building Company operating throughout the Channel Islands, which provides a client focused professional construction service, and delivers projects to a high quality, on-time and within budget.</p>
        <p>We are the designer • We are the builder</p>
        <p>More specifically, we design and build new homes, refurbishments, extensions and commercial projects.</p>
        <p>Traditionally,the relationship between architect and builder has been mutally exclusive. The architect, a name on the builder's plans; the builder, a name in the architect's email. But this never made any sense to us.</p>
        <p>We Bridge the Gap</p>
        <p>From the project manager to the carpenter, we are a collection of people who share a passion of building beautiful things - a physical space that goes beyond bricks and mortar, and its this unique releationship that allows us to create your home.</p>
