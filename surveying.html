        <h2>What does a QS do?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><span>Bamboo's quantity surveyor will advise on the site's potential and determine the feasibility of what a client can afford to build.</span></li>

      <h2>What Makes a Good Surveyor?</h2>
        <!-- <p>Quantity Surveyors are the financial whiz-kids of the industry! They are highly numerate and typically control an entire project budget. To put that into context, on a new build high school the Senior Quantity Surveyor could be responsible for over £20million of spend.  </p> -->
        <p>Bamboo's quantity surveyors are building industry experts who take pride in working with clients. They know a great deal about building legislation, building materials, design etc. They are highly organised and great negotiators.</p>
        <h2>Cost Control &amp; Contract Advice</h2>
        <p>Bamboo consistently delivers honest advice to clients, with a valued ‘no surprises’ approach to cost monitoring. Detailed and concise reports are provided on a regular basis, keeping you fully informed of any possible cost variances throughout the project. Pride is taken in understanding all elements of the design brief, and Bamboo will go the ‘extra mile’ to get the job done - identifying risk and providing consistent, easy to understand communication at all stages of the project lifecycle.</p>
        <h2>Tender Documentation</h2>
        <p>One of Bamboo's core skills - the production of accurate tender documentation is one of the critical elements of a project’s success. Careful and timely production of all the relevant documentation, including where necessary, bills of quantities, employer's requirements and schedules of rates. This reduces risk and promotes certainty of delivering the project on time and to budget.</p>
