        <h2>What Bamboo Design &amp; Build is Made Of</h2>
        <p>Architects, Technicians, Project Managers, Builders, All Rounders - a collection of people who live and breathe designing and building. We share more than this, we all have the same sneaking suspicion that builders usually disappoint people, the process is arduous, the client has to fight every step of the way for what they want! It doesn't need to be this way...</p>
        <p>Building and making things should be inspiring and enjoyable - from the first disscussion to the last brush stroke. Here's how we believe it can be achieved.</p>

      <h2>Design How it Should Be</h2>
        <p>For us, design goes far beyond how something looks, its how it's built and how it works - function and form. You need to consider the whole picture to create something great. Something that makes you proud and still works brilliantly years down the line.</p>
        <h2>The Lost Art of Building</h2>
        <p>The designs are only as good as the man banging in the nails, or as we like to call them, craftsmen. We might draw something beautiful on paper, but without a good team of people to realise it, that's all it will ever be, but more than this, we believe these should be people you'll welcome into your homes, dare we say it you might even like having them around.</p>

        <h2>Working As One</h2>
        <p>Designers and builders working together - it might not sound radical, but in industry terms it is, and the results are telling. The process runs smoother, the design is more considered, the difficult becomes more achievable, which in turn makes for the better on every level.</p>
