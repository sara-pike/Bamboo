      <h2>Design As Function &amp; Form</h2>
        <p>At Bamboo, design is far more than just aesthetics, it is about considering the bigger picture, and constructing something that will not only look great, but also stand the test of time.</p>
        <h2>The Art of Construction</h2>
        <p>A design is only as good as its craftsmen, and without a specialist team of highly skilled people to realise a beautiful design, it will only ever be just that.</p>

        <h2>Working Together</h2>
        <p>Bamboo Construction's ethos of designers and craftsmen working together is a new concept in industry terms, which has telling results - the process from design through to construction is now a smooth one, allowing for difficulties to be quickly overcome, leading to much better results on every level.</p>
